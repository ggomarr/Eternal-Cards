# Eternal Card Collection Extractor

This project was a lot of fun - it includes simulating mouse activity and taking screenshots on one end, and image feature extraction and classification (in a library of 1000+ options) on the other. Plus, it helped me continue using the great deck search offered by Eternal Warcry when Extesy's deck tracker stopped being updated. (Come back! We miss you!)

Unfortunately a full run takes some 10 min, but I guess that is the price you pay for direct image identification.

It is not quite for the faint of heart, for it may require tweaking if you want to use it. Take it as a learning opportunity and I will do what I can to help you out, just let me know!

In order to use it you will need some Python knowledge, including how to run Jupyter notebooks and how to install packages. If you are familiar with the language you can probably take the code and build your own script though.

Have fun with this, and keep playing!

Special thanks to Eternal Warcry for allowing me to use their assets!
